  In order to easily and securely interact with an Ethereum blockchain
  As a user
  I want to create and use a v3 keystore

  Scenario: Create a new v3 keystore
    Given I open the url "https://localhost:3000/#/wallet"
    Then I expect that element "button=Create" becomes visible
    When I click on the element "button=Create"
    Then I expect that element ".header*=Single Account" becomes visible
    When I click on the element ".header*=Single Account"
    Then I expect that element ".header=Create V3 Wallet" becomes visible
    And I expect that element ".message*=Single Account" is visible
    When I set "test_name" to the inputfield "[name='name']"
    And I set "testing" to the inputfield "[name='password']"
    And I set "testing" to the inputfield "[name='confirmPassword']"
    And I click on the element "button=OK"
    Then I expect that element ".content*=test_name" becomes visible

  Scenario: Edit v3 keystore name
    When I click on the element ".label*=Account Settings"
    Then I expect that element ".header=Edit Keystore: Single Account" becomes visible
    When I set "updated_test_name" to the inputfield "[name='name']"
    And I click on the element "button=OK"
    Then I expect that element ".content*=updated_test_name" becomes visible

  # set test creating with a PK
  # test downloading the v3 keystore
  # test custom values

  # removing keystore
  Scenario: Remove v3 keystore name
    When I click on the element ".label*=Account Settings"
    Then I expect that element ".header=Edit Keystore: Single Account" becomes visible
    When I click on the element "button=Remove"
    Then I expect that element ".header=Please Confirm" becomes visible
    When I click on the element "button=Confirm"
    Then I expect that element ".content*=updated_test_name" is not visible
